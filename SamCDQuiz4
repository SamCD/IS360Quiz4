#Question1
#1. Learn a programming language to be able to extract data
#2. Clean up your data to remove extraneous information
#3. Use your human capabilities to look at the data as a whole
#4. Learn how to read models to see what is important
#5. Learn to understand the language of data and create novel material

#Question2
#My experience with R and programming has shown me that the most important part is the foundation.
#You can have the most brilliant team working with your code, however if the code is fundamentally
#flawed, it is worthless. Therefore, I think that a well-designed interface,
#decently implemented is more valuable.

#Question3
format(Sys.Date(), "%j")

#Question4
#POSIXlt is beneficial for calculating a statistic involving dates, i.e.
#number of births per day over a given time period (no.births / (as.POSIXlt(date2) - as.POSIXlt(date1))
#POSIXct would be better for a value that needs continuous updating i.e. the date of a monthly recurring payment

#Question5
CSAge <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.Date()) - as.POSIXlt("1916-04-30", format = "%Y-%m-%d", tz = "UTC")
print(CSAge)

#Question6
month <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
day <- c(23, 13, 14, 04, 07, 28)
year <- c(1998, 1997, 2004, 2014, 1984, 1950)
cal <- data.frame(month, day, year)
print(cal)
cal$Date <- as.Date( paste( cal$month , cal$day , cal$year , sep = "-" )  , format = "%m-%d-%Y" )
str(cal) 

#Question7
dt <- as.Date("01-15-1999", format = "%m-%d-%y")

#Question8
month.dt <- format(dt, "%m")

#Question9
seq(as.Date("2005-01-01"), as.Date("2014-12-31"), by = "day")

#Question10
#stringsAsFactors
